\title{Quality Control-Robust Spline Correction (QC-RSC)}
\usage{
QCRSC(df, order, batch, classes, spar = 0, log = TRUE, minQC = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame of values to be corrected (samples in columns and features in rows).}

\item{order}{A numeric vector indicating the order in which samples were measured.}

\item{batch}{A vector indicating the batch each sample was measured in. If only one batch then all values should be set to 1.}

\item{classes}{A factor or character vector of sample classes. All QC samples should be labelled  "QC".}

\item{spar}{Spline smoothing parameter. Should be in the range 0 to 1. If set to 0 it will be estimated using leave-one-out cross-validation.}

\item{log}{TRUE or FALSE to perform the signal correction fit on the log scaled data. Default is TRUE.}

\item{minQC}{Minimum number of QC samples required for signal correction.}
}
\description{
Implementation of signal correction algorithm as described in Kirwan et al, Anal. Bioanal. Chem., 405 (15), 2013
}
\details{
The smoothing parameter (spar) can be optimised using leave-one-out cross validation to avoid overfitting.
